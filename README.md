# Personal

## Description
    This project will be used as a living document that will grow and change as my skills in coding improve. 
  Using HTML and CSS the goal was to create a dynamic website that incorporates media querries, :hover and flexbox.
  While working through this project, I was challenged in many ways I did not initially anticipate.
  Learning focus items that this project highlighted were how to contruct and design and the complexity that it can create in a very short about of time.
  In the end I have a finished product that for at the time I am happy with and will contiue to develop as my education cieling increases.
